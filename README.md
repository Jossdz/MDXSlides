## Usage

Open the `src/deck.mdx` and start typing your slides and separate each one with `---`.

````mdx
# This is the title of my deck
---
# About Me
---
```jsx
<CodeSnippet />

import Demo from './components/Demo'

<Demo />

# The end

  npm run dev

To use presenter mode:

- Open two windows in the same browser, with the same URL on two different screens. (this should work in both development and exported presentations)
- In your window press the `Option + P` (`Alt + P`) key to enter presenter mode.
- Display the other window on the screen for the audience to see.
- Control the presentation from your window by using the left and right arrow keys; the other window should stay in sync

### Speaker Notes

Notes that only show in presenter mode can be added to any slide.
Speaker notes can be added in one of the following two ways:

**Markdown:** Use the `notes` language attribute in a fenced code block to add speaker notes.
